>comment: for this assignment, the main visual layout is the bar charts, which are controls: average minimum temperature, average maximum temperature and average precipitation. Average Max VS MIN tab is an extra layout I did for exploring the line chart representation of my dataset, I have include some reasoning behind that on the site, you can ignore this part.
